## Cryptocurrency values in Real Time 
For this first version of the project, I have chosen 12 cryptocurrencies but future versions will increase the number of cryptocurrencies analized. [Financial Modeling Prep API](https://financialmodelingprep.com/developer/docs/) is the public API used to obtain historic and current cryptocurrency values. The current cryptocurrency values are dispayed in "Home":

## Historic set of values  
You can access to historic values choosing the period you want and displaying it in a candlestick chart (values of open/high/low/close are shown of each day). Users can access to this seccion clicking in the cryptocurrency they want in "Home".
