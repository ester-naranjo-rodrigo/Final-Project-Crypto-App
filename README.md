# Final-Project-Crypto-App

This project is a web application where users can access to the following funcionalities:
  - Without log in:
    - Current values of cryptocurrencies
    - Historic chart and values of cryptocurrencies
    - Currency converter
    
  - With log in:
    - Profile where users can store and see their investments
    - Detailed charts of each cryptocurrency investment along time
## Cryptocurrency values in Real Time 
For this first version of the project, I have chosen 12 cryptocurrencies but future versions will increase the number of cryptocurrencies analized. [Financial Modeling Prep API](https://financialmodelingprep.com/developer/docs/) is the public API used to obtain historic and current cryptocurrency values. The current cryptocurrency values are dispayed in "Home":

## Historic set of values  
You can access to historic values choosing the period you want and displaying it in a candlestick chart (values of open/high/low/close are shown of each day).
